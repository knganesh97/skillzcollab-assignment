This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Design Decisions

- **Framework**: Chose Next.js for its hybrid static & server rendering, built-in routing, and strong developer experience.
- **Directory Structure**: Followed the default Next.js app directory structure for clarity and maintainability.
- **Styling**: Utilized Next.js built-in font optimization and Tailwind CSS for scoped, maintainable styles.
- **TypeScript**: Enabled TypeScript for type safety and better developer tooling.
- **Component Structure**: Adopted a modular, reusable component approach to promote code reuse and easier testing.
- **State Management**: Preferred Reactâ€™s built-in state management for simplicity; considered external libraries only when required.
- **Deployment**: Optimized for deployment on Vercel for seamless CI/CD and performance.

> These decisions aim to balance scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity.
